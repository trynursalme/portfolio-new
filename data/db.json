    "about": "I am an Electrical & Computer Engineer with a strong foundation in machine learning, data science, and digital monitoring systems—driven by a commitment to expand access to essential services in resource-constrained environments. Currently serving as an IT Assistant at ZOA Ethiopia, I support programmes that enhance clean water access and renewable energy adoption, integrating digital tools that strengthen decision-making in the field.\r\n\r\nAs a graduate of the UNDP Frontier Tech Leaders Programme, I developed predictive models to identify communities most vulnerable to water scarcity, demonstrating the role of data intelligence in improving service reliability and resilience. I am passionate about bridging engineering, data, and humanitarian action to deliver practical solutions that create measurable impact. I am continuously seeking opportunities—such as the Young Expert Programme—to scale this impact further and contribute to sustainable development through innovation, collaboration, and evidence-based systems.",

      "content": "# Solar Radiation Data Analysis Project\n\n### Overview\n#### The goal of this project is to analyze solar radiation measurement data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo to identify high-potential regions for solar installations. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical thinking, visualization, and dashboard development using Streamlit.\n\n## Business Objective\n#### The objective of this project is to support MoonLight Energy Solutions in developing a strategic approach to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability through targeted solar investments. As an Analytics Engineer, the task is to:\n\n#### Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on environmental measurement data.\n#### Translate insights into actionable recommendations for identifying high-potential regions for solar installations.\n#### Build a Streamlit dashboard to visualize key findings and trends.\n***\n## Dataset Overview\n#### The dataset used in this project is extracted and aggregated from Solar Radiation Measurement Data . Each row contains the following variables:\n\n#### * Timestamp : Date and time of each observation.\n#### * GHI (W/m²) : Global Horizontal Irradiance.\n#### * DNI (W/m²) : Direct Normal Irradiance.\n#### * DHI (W/m²) : Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance.\n#### * ModA & ModB (W/m²) : Sensor measurements.\n#### * Tamb (°C) : Ambient Temperature.\n#### * RH(%) : Relative Humidity.\n#### * WS (m/s) : Wind Speed.\n#### * WSgust (m/s) : Maximum Wind Gust Speed.\n#### * WD (°N to east) : Wind Direction.\n#### * BP (hPa) : Barometric Pressure.\n#### * Cleaning (1 or 0) : Indicates whether cleaning events occurred.\n#### * Precipitation (mm/min) : Precipitation rate.\n#### * TModA & TModB (°C) : Module temperatures.\n#### * Country : Region (Benin, Sierra Leone, Togo).\n\n\n## Dashboard Development\n#### * Design and developed a Streamlit dashboard to visualize key insight.\n#### * Integrated interactive features such as sliders, dropdowns, and buttons.\n#### * Deployed the dashboard to streamlit Community Cloud.\n\n*** \n\n## Key Features of the dashboard.\n#### The streamlit dashboard includes the following interactive visualizations: \n\n#### * ***Line Charts :*** Time Series analysis of GHI, DNI, DHI, and Tamb.\n#### * ***Histogram :*** Frequency distributions of key variables.\n#### * ***Polar plots :*** Wind speed and direction distribution.\n#### * ***Scatter Plots :*** Relationships between variables like GHI vs. Tamb\n#### * ***Outlier Detection :*** Highlighting anomalies using Z-scores.\n\n***\n\n# How to Run the Project\n## Prerequisites\n#### * Python 3.x installed\n#### * Required Libraries installed via requirements.txt\n\n## Steps\n\n#### Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/trynursalme/KAIM-Week0.git\ncd KAIM-Weeko\n#### Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n#### Run the Streamlit app \nstreamlit run app/main.py\n\n## Future Improvements\n#### * Incorporate machine learning models to predict solar irradiance.\n#### * Add more advanced statistical analyses (e.g., hypothesis testing).\n#### * Enhance the dashboard with additional interactivity and visualizations.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n#### Special thanks to the entire 10 Academy team for their guidance and support throughout this challenge.\n\n## Contributing\n#### If you’d like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. \n#### For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you’d like to add or modify.",
